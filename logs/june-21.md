# 🗓 June 21, 2025

### 🎯 What I learned today:
- I made my first GitHub repo 😭✌️
- Started Array Lecture in Codeacademy
- Started Bitwise Operators in GeeksforGeeks
- Practiced some Java (barely survived)

### 😵 Confused about:
- Git commands... they scare me
- Bitwise Operators?? What are they??

### 💡 Realizations:
> I don’t need to know everything. I just need to start.
